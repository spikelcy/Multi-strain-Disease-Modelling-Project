# Community structure and its effects on multi-strain disease diversity and structure Research Project
COMP90055 Project

Author: Spike Lee

Project Supervisor: Dr Nic Geard & Dr Rebecca Chisholm , University of Melbourne.

Description: This repository contains code written and used for my Master's theis research project.
             Basis of code was from a previous student's work.Based on work done by previous student and Model
             found in Buckee et al.(2004,2007).
             
Files:
* LHS.py : Latin HyperCube Sampling(LHS) of parameters for Models
* linear_network_testing.py : Linear communities Network testing and visualization
* network.py : Multistrain Disease Models and functions used
* utils.py : Utilities used by other .py files
